# GitHub-Intro
Repository for an introduction to GitHub presentation

This repo contains a .ppt file and a folder containing dfnWorks source Files. The PowerPoint file can be used for presentations about the general use of Git and GitHub and why people may want to use it for research related collaborative projects. 

The DFN folder contains the necessary source files to run a simple dfnWorks run. We use the driver.py file specifically to show how two users can collaborate with the same set of source files. In this example, we use a HPC to run the files and then a second person realizes that the domain size was wrong! Oops! Luckily, the second person can change the driver.py file on their computer and push the fix. Then, the person on the HPC will pull the change and show how seamless it can be.

This is hopefully a work in progress and we are open to updates!
